# Historical Context

The transposition cipher is a simple data encryption scheme in which plaintext characters are shifted in some regular pattern to form ciphertext. 
It was used by the Greeks, who created a special tool, called scytale, to make message encryption and decryption easier. 
Currently, it is usually used with a piece of paper.
