# Historical Context

The transposition cipher is a simple data encryption scheme in which plaintext characters are shifted in some regular pattern to form ciphertext. 
It was used by the Greeks, who created a special tool, called scytale, to make message encryption and decryption easier. 
It is not used as much now because it is considered weak. It doesn't change the letters in the plaintext like a caesar cipher and it doesn't cover up frequencies of letters. An easy way to make it more secure is encrypting it twice.
