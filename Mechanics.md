**Mechanics**


**How it works:** The alphabet is divided into four boxes of uppercase and lowercase letters. The two parties will communicate beforehand in which order they will want to go about the tables (left to right, top to bottom, etc.). Then the words of the parties' are split into pairs (ex. CATS => CA TS). Then locate the pairs in the adjacent boxes in order to encrypt. The process of encryption and decryption is the same so the cipher is symmetric.

Ex. Encrypt: 

split into pairs: four => FO and UR

find lowercase f and o

find the letters in the corresponding line that the letters make in the uppercase boxes

FO=>MX

find lowercase u and r 

find the letters in the corresponding line that the letters make in the uppercase boxes
 
 UR=>KW
  
  FOUR=> MXKW
  


Ex. Decrypt: MXKW

split into pairs: MX KW

find uppercase M and X

find the letters in the corresponding line that the letters make in the lowercase boxes

MX=> FO

find uppercase K and W

find the letters in the corresponding line that the letters make in the lowercase boxes

KW=> UR

FO UR

FOUR
