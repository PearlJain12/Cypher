How it works: The alphabet is divided into four boxes of uppercase and lowercase letters. The two parties will communicate beforehand in which order they will want to go about the tables (left to right, top to bottom, etc.). Then the words of the parties' are split into pairs (ex. CATS => CA TS). Then locate the pairs in the adjacent boxes in order to encrypt.
