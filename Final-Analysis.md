The four-square method was efective when it was in it's prime but it had the downside of being a bit slow. Another reason it isn't used much anymore is the fact that computers now a days could decode them quite quickly.
But when computers weren't that fast it was actually quite effective. There is a similar but more modern version of this code called the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which is also a symmetric key encryption.
