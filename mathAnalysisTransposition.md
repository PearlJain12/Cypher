# Mathematical Analysis:


The amount of possible codes depends on the number of letters in the message and what the key is. (read the Mechanics page for a detailed explanation)
The Transposition Cipher is very much like a anagram or a letter jumble it takes the word and mixes up the letters in a different order (it is more complicated but that is the extreme basic). These alone are relatively easy to crack so they often get paired up with another cipher to make it very hard to crack. 
There is really no mathmatical complexity invoved you just need to be able to make a table with the amount of rows in the key and then write it out but one character per table until you reach the last one then slide down to the next layer.
