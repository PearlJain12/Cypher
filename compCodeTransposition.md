The 
[online tool](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/columnar-transposition-cipher)
encrypts and decrypts using the transposition cipher.

You add a message to the large textbox and a key in an ordered pair. The key creates the table your transposition cipher will use. Then you click encode and get your encrypted message.

To decrypt, you enter your encrypted message and enter the key in an ordered pair and click decode. 

If you don't know the key, you can also click auto solve and it brute forces the encrypted message to find the plain text.
