Transpotition is a method of encryption where the positions held by letters are shifted according to a set rate which makes it so the letters are constantly changing.
One of the downsides is that this type of cypher is more laborious and error prone than the more simple cyphers. Some similar cyphers are the Bifid cipher, the Trifid cypher, the ADFGVX cipher, and the VIC cipher.
